## 2025-08-12 – Initial scaffold, push to org

- Timestamp: 2025-08-12
- Scope:
  - Repo scaffolded locally (single package with CLI+GUI).
  - Created: pyproject.toml, README.md, DESIGN.md, LICENSE (MIT), .gitignore.
  - Source modules added under src/wbridge/: app.py, cli.py, server_ipc.py, client_ipc.py, history.py, config.py, actions.py, gnome_shortcuts.py, platform.py, logging_setup.py, __init__.py.
  - IPC server started from GUI; ui.show handler implemented; CLI wired to IPC.
- Local commit:
  - d694c5f chore: scaffold wbridge (CLI+GUI, IPC server/client, docs, config)
- Remote integration:
  - Remote default branch contained initial skeleton (e.g., LICENSE). Performed merge favoring local scaffold for conflicts.
  - Merge and push completed.
  - Remote tip: bbd642f main
- Notes:
  - SSH key added and authorized for org; push now functional.
  - LICENSE conflict auto-merged using recursive strategy (ours preference). Final license retained as MIT from local scaffold.

Next Steps (per DESIGN.md Checklist)
- Extend IPC handler to support: selection.get/set, history.list/apply/swap, action.run/trigger.
- Add GUI tabs (History/Actions/Settings/Status) and wire to services.
- Implement actions management UI and settings loading.
- Provide GNOME shortcuts install/remove UI and Autostart toggle.
